// Polyfills

// Avoid overwriting the native startsWith method:
if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
  String.prototype.startsWith = function (searchString, position) {
    position = position || 0;
    return this.substr(position, searchString.length) === searchString;
  };
}

/* Transpiling
The most popular JavaScript transpiler is called Babel.

Babel's original name was slightly more descriptive - 6to5. This was because, originally, Babel converted ES6 code to ES5 code. Now, Babel does a lot more. It'll convert ES6 to ES5, JSX to JavaScript, and Flow to JavaScript.*/
